 *
 * A size or a street address is required on top of price and rooms. City,
 * rooms and price alone are not distinctive enough: two different 3-room flats
 * at 6,000 ₪ in one city are perfectly ordinary, and merging them would
 * silently drop a real listing - a worse failure than a duplicate alert.
 *
 * Returns null when the listing is too vague to fingerprint safely, in which
 * case it is deduped by source id alone.
 *
 * The street wins over the size when both are known, and the house number is
 * dropped. Choosing per listing - size when known, street otherwise - meant
 * two boards carrying one flat produced different keys whenever they
 * disagreed about the size or only one of them published it, which is exactly
 * the pair the fingerprint exists to collapse. yad2 listed נהר הירדן 24 at
 * 170 m² and realta the same flat as נהר הירדן with no size; both were sent.
 *
 * Dropping the house number is what makes a street comparable at all, since
 * boards include it inconsistently, and it is the one loosening here: two
 * different flats on one street at the same price with the same room count
 * now merge. Measured over three weeks of real data that rule collapsed 34
 * groups, of which 5 had sizes more than 15% apart - so at most a handful of
 * genuine listings are traded for 29 duplicates removed.
