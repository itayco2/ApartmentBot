/**
 * Sources come in three kinds.
 *
 * **Native parsers** read data that is already structured, so they are cheap,
 * exact and run every cycle:
 *  - yad2     - the largest board. Its website is unreachable behind Radware,
 *               but the gateway's paged feed is open; it is read from the top
 *               until a page holds nothing new, and posting dates are
 *               recovered from the photo URLs.
 *  - realta   - aggregates Yad2, Madlan, OnMap, Komo and Facebook Marketplace,
 *               and is the only source publishing a real date on every listing.
 *  - homeless - mobile site, plain server-rendered HTML.
 *  - onmap    - public JSON API; no Modi'in inventory today, but cheap to ask.
 *  - madlan   - its own GraphQL API. The site and `/api2` are behind
 *               PerimeterX, but `/api3` is not; it has no city filter, so it
 *               is asked for the newest listings in the country and the city
 *               is matched afterwards.
 *
 * **Model-extracted sources** cover the long tail of Israeli boards that have
 * no API: fetch the page, hand the text to Gemini, get listings back. Adding
 * one is a URL in sites.ts, and a site redesign degrades quality instead of
 * silently breaking a scraper. They run hourly.
 *
 * **Free-text posts** - public Telegram channels through their web preview,
 * and Facebook groups through the owner's own logged-in session (inert unless
 * FACEBOOK_ENABLED is set after a successful login). Both ask the store
 * whether a post was already read, so feeds repeating the same posts for
 * days cost no model calls.
 *
 * Which of these actually run is the SOURCES setting; unset means all of them.
 * Cross-source fingerprinting means a flat that Realta re-publishes from Yad2
 * or Madlan is still only alerted once, whichever combination is switched on.
